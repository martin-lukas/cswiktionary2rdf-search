# CsWiktionary2RDF - Search App
CswWktionary2RDF extracts information from the Czech 
Wiktionary project into 
a machine-readable format RDF. 

This repository 
 contains a web app that is able to search the 
 RDF model 
 based on the input word, and find all the pages 
that contain that word, together with the properties of that word form, if it has any.
